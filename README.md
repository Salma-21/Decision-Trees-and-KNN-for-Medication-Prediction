# Decision-Trees-and-KNN-for-Medication-Prediction
This machine learning project comprises two main problems. In the first problem, the objective is to build a predictive model for determining medication types based on patient characteristics using Decision Trees in Scikit-learn. Two experiments involve fixed and varied train-test split ratios, assessing decision tree sizes and accuracies. The second problem focuses on implementing a KNN classifier from scratch using Python on the diabetes dataset. Multiple iterations with varying k values, Euclidean distance calculations, and Distance-Weighted Voting for tie-breaking are performed. The project emphasizes data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result visualization, providing a holistic exploration of machine learning techniques.
